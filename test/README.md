# Regression tests

Playwright drives the real app in headless Chromium: the site build in `docs/`,
served locally, and the single file `dist/jumpstart-3d.html`, opened from disk
the way users open it. `npm test` rebuilds both first.

```
npm test              both builds
npm run test:site     docs/ only (fastest while working)
npm run test:single   dist/ only
```

First time: `npm install`, then `npx playwright install chromium`. The same
suite runs on GitHub Actions for every pull request (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).

## What runs

- `smoke.spec.mjs`: the app boots with the kernel ready and no console errors;
  the About dialog keeps the author's credit; dragging a shape tile makes a
  body; a fillet and a chamfer build (the kernel works), once from a document
  and once through the Fillet tool with a click on the edge; Mesh detail
  changes the triangle count; STL, OBJ, STEP and the project file download;
  FlexiGen, Mesh to STEP and Chisel open and render, and Mesh to STEP's
  pop-out tab boots on its own; a saved design is back after a reload.
- `golden.spec.mjs`: every design in `projects/` is loaded, exported as STL,
  OBJ and STEP through the real menu, and the bytes are hashed against
  `golden.json` (the STEP timestamp and OpenCascade's export counter are
  blanked first). The entry also keeps
  each body's volume and the STL triangle count, so a mismatch says whether
  the shape changed or only its tessellation.

When a hash moves and the change was intended, re-record:

```
npm run test:update
```

and commit the new `golden.json` with the change that caused it. (The script
sets `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` and records from the site build; in PowerShell run
`$env:UPDATE_GOLDEN=1; npx playwright test --project=site` instead.)

## Adding a design

Drop a project file in `projects/` (Export > Save Project File, or a
hand-written document like the existing ones) and re-record. Keep designs
small: each one is built, exported three times and hashed on every run.

## How the tests reach the app

`src/app.js` ends with three lines that put `app`, `store` and `findBody` on
`window`, exactly what the author's `app/test/dbg.js` did for his own
Playwright scripts (in the v1.94 source zip on the `upstream-originals`
release). The helpers in `helpers.mjs` load a design with `__store.load`, wait
until the kernel queue is empty and every body has a mesh, read volumes from
`__app.scene.views`, and catch downloads from the Export menu.
